0,"Systems, methods, and apparatus for geolocation platform mechanics 
        ","Systems, apparatus, methods, and articles of manufacture provide for geolocating a user and/or a user device, based on one or more location data sources. Some embodiments may include use of a user authentication process (e.g., a two-factor authentication service) to improve confidence in the determined location of a user device. In one embodiment, a user and/or a user device may be allowed or denied access to restricted access content based on the determined location of the device.

1,"User interface mechanics 
        ","Methods, computer readable media, and apparatuses for providing enhanced user interface mechanics are presented. In one arrangement, a scrollable list of content items may be displayed. Input associated with a scroll command may be received. Then, based on the scroll command, a scrollable refresh trigger may be displayed. Subsequently, the scrollable list of content items may be refreshed in response to determining, based on the scroll command, that the scrollable refresh trigger has been activated. In at least one instance, it may be determined that the scrollable refresh trigger has been activated in response to determining that the scroll command was completed while the scrollable refresh trigger was fully displayed.

2,"Automated inspiratory muscle training for patients receiving mechanical ventilation 
      ","A system and method for automated inspiratory muscle strength exercise includes software for setting a mechanical ventilator for a pressure regulated breath with an initial pressure target that is at the highest pressure setting a patient can tolerate and increasing the pressure target as tolerated.

3,"Apparatus and method using measurements taken while drilling to map mechanical boundaries and mechanical rock properties along a borehole 
        ","An apparatus and method of using drilling vibrations generated by the deformation of a rock formation in response to forces acting on the rock formation, where the forces are related to a drill bit and/or drilling fluid system, to identify the nature and occurrence of fractures, fracture swarms and other mechanical discontinuities (boundaries) such as bedding planes and/or faults that offset or otherwise separate rock formations with different mechanical rock properties.

4,"A kind of unmanned plane formation method based on small birds cluster fly mechanics 
        ","The present invention is a kind of unmanned plane formation method based on small birds cluster fly mechanics, implementation step are as follows: step 1: Communication Network for UAVS of the design based on flock of birds hierarchical structure；Step 2: formation omniselector of the design based on flock of birds foraging behavior；Step 3: formation control device of the design based on flock of birds neighbours' interbehavior；Step 4: the offline mode switch based on swarm behavior.This method can realize stable multiple no-manned plane formation configuration, adapt to different task environment, provide a kind of possible technique means to solve the formation of small drone large-scale cluster.
