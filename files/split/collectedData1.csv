1,"Collaborative diplomacy mechanics 
        ","A collaborative diplomacy mechanics system for an online game is described. A player selects an ally to be engaged in a combat mode of an online social game against an enemy. The profile of the selected ally is retrieved. An ally power up weapon is generated based on the profile of the selected ally. The ally power up weapon is applied against a combat unit of an enemy of a player in the combat mode. The ally power up weapon can also be applied on a combat unit of the player in the combat mode.

2,"Terrain modeling method and system integrating geometric characteristics and mechanical characteristics 
        ","The invention provides a terrain modeling method and a system fusing geometric characteristics and mechanical characteristics, which relate to the technical field of environmental modeling and comprise the steps of obtaining a color image and a depth image of a detection area, carrying out terrain semantic segmentation on the color image, fusing a semantic segmentation result and depth information contained in the depth image at the same moment, and generating semantic point cloud; mapping the semantic point cloud to a grid map under a map coordinate system to generate a corresponding grid, and updating an elevation value and semantic information in the semantic point cloud to the corresponding grid; and performing ground mechanics characteristic calculation according to the semantic information, updating a calculation result to the corresponding grid, and generating a terrain model. According to the invention, mechanical characteristic parameters are added into terrain factors, and terrain characterization is innovatively carried out from two dimensions of geometric characteristics and mechanical characteristics. The invention utilizes the visual perception mode to deduce the ground pressure bearing characteristic and the shearing characteristic of the non-contact area in advance, thereby enlarging the perception range.
