0,"Transcatheter mitral valve prosthesis 
        ","A prosthetic cardiac valve comprises an anchor having an atrial skirt, an annular region, and a ventricular skirt. The prosthetic valve also has a plurality of prosthetic valve leaflets each having a first end and a free end. The first end is coupled with the anchor and the free end is opposite the first end. The prosthetic cardiac valve has an open configuration in which the free ends of the prosthetic valve leaflets are disposed away from one another to allow antegrade blood flow therepast, and a closed configuration in which the free ends of the prosthetic valve leaflets engage one another and substantially prevent retrograde blood flow therepast. The anchor has a collapsed configuration for delivery to the heart and an expanded configuration for anchoring the prosthetic cardiac valve to a patient's heart.

1,"System and method for communication using orbital angular momentum with multiple layer overlay modulation 
        ","A system includes mode division multiplexing (MDM) processing circuitry for applying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) to each of a first group of a plurality of input signals and multiplexing the OAM processed signals together. Second processing circuitry performs wavelength distribution multiplexing (WDM) on a second group of the plurality of input signals, wherein the WDM processed signals and the MDM processed signals are orthogonal to one another. Combining circuitry combines the WDM processed signals and the MDM processed signals. Polarization processing circuitry adds polarization to at least one of the WDM processed signals, and the MDM processed signals and a transmitter transmits the combine and polarized processed signal over a link.
