0,Peer,"Data characterizing historical skills-based gaming metrics for a first user and historical skills-based gaming metrics for at least one second user is accessed. Using the accessed data and a set of rules, a targeted advertisement to present to the first user is determined. The targeted advertisement specifies at least one skills-based game and a characterization of the at least one second user's historical skills-based gaming metrics. The targeted advertisement is generated. Data characterizing the targeted advertisement is provided. Related apparatus, systems, techniques, and articles are also described.

1,"Service advisor accounts for remote service monitoring of a vehicle 
        ","Methods and systems are provided. One method includes receiving a request, at a server, to establish an advisor account for a vehicle associated with a user account. The request identifies a service entity and a vehicle service to be assigned to the service entity. The service entity is configured to receive said diagnostics data of the vehicle. The advisor account is associated to the service entity. Programming data is sent to the vehicle for use by a computer of the vehicle to identify select diagnostics data that relates to the vehicle service and to make accessible said select diagnostics data to the advisor account. The advisor account is made accessible to the service entity subsequent to establishing of the advisor account. The server receives select diagnostics data from the vehicle regarding the vehicle service, and the select diagnostics data is accessible for viewing and/or processing by a device of the service entity. The select diagnostics data produces updates that identify characteristics or changes in characteristics that relate to the vehicle service, and the server uses the identified characteristics or changes in characteristics to trigger a notification to the service entity regarding a problem or potential problem regarding the vehicle service.

2,"Transvascular diaphragm pacing systems and methods of use 
        ","Transvascular diaphragm pacing systems (TDPS) and methods are disclosed for providing respiratory therapy to a patient. The TDPS can provide rapid insertion and deployment of endovascular pacing electrodes in critically ill patients who require intubation and invasive PPMV in order to support the physiological requirements of the human ventilatory system. The systems and methods make best use of the contractile properties of the diaphragm muscle and prevent muscle disuse and muscle atrophy. This can be carried out by engaging the phrenic nerves using patterned functional electrical stimulation applied to endovascular electrodes that are temporarily and reversibly inserted in central veins of the patient, such as the left subclavian vein and the superior vena cava. The TDPS can be designed to seamlessly interface with any commercially available positive-pressure ventilatory assistance/support equipment such as is commonly in use in hospital intensive care units (ICU) for treating critically ill patients with breathing insufficiencies, pain, trauma, sepsis or neurological diseases or deficits.
