1,"Intelligent motion capture element 
        ","Intelligent motion capture element that includes sensor personalities that optimize the sensor for specific movements and/or pieces of equipment and/or clothing and may be retrofitted onto existing equipment or interchanged therebetween and automatically detected for example to switch personalities. May be used for low power applications and accurate data capture for use in healthcare compliance, sporting, gaming, military, virtual reality, industrial, retail loss tracking, security, baby and elderly monitoring and other applications for example obtained from a motion capture element and relayed to a database via a mobile phone. System obtains data from motion capture elements, analyzes data and stores data in database for use in these applications and/or data mining. Enables unique displays associated with the user, such as 3D overlays onto images of the user to visually depict the captured motion data. Enables performance related equipment fitting and purchase. Includes active and passive identifier capabilities.

2,"Expandable fusion device with independent expansion systems 
        ","Expandable spinal fusion devices, systems, and methods of using them are provided, and they can be inserted in a subject in a collapsed state through a small surgical corridor, and the expand cephalocaudal only, transverse only, or in both directions, in which direction of expansion can also be obtained independently, if desired, after the insertion. These inventions are valuable in reducing risk and surgical complexity, allowing for an on-the-fly selection of a desirable width footprint, a desired control of height expansion through a gradual cephalocaudal expansion, and a desired control of the alignment of the adjacent vertebral bodies. Devices, systems, and methods are also offered to provide a desired control of the contact area desired between the device and the upper and lower vertebral endplates achieved, for example, using an interdigitated endplate system.

3,"Methods, systems, apparatuses and devices for facilitating motion analysis in an environment 
        ","Disclosed herein is a system for facilitating motion analysis in an environment, in accordance with some embodiments. Accordingly, the system may include a plurality of motions sensors configured to be disposed in the environment. Further, the plurality of motion sensors may be configured to generate a plurality of motion data corresponding to at least one motion of at least one object in the environment. Further, the system may include a plurality of video cameras disposable at a plurality of key locations in the environment. Further, at least one video camera may be configured to transmit a part of a corresponding image sequence to a remote monitoring center through at least one gateway. Further, the system may include at least one gateway disposable proximal to the environment, which may be configured as a two-way interface capable of communicating with the remote monitoring center and the plurality of motion sensors.
