0,Method for forming vertical spacers for spacer,"A method of forming vertical spacers for spacer-defined multiple patterning, includes: depositing a first conformal pattern-transfer film having a first film stress, and continuously depositing a second conformal pattern-transfer film having a second film stress on a template; dry-etching the template except for a core material and a vertical portion of the first and second pattern-transfer films to form vertical spacers; and dry-etching the core material, forming a vacant space between the vertical spacers, wherein by adjusting the difference in film stress between the first and second pattern-transfer films, the leaning angle of the spacers is adjusted.

1,"Methods and devices for controlling a shapeable medical device 
        ","Systems and methods are described herein that improve control of a shapeable or steerable instrument using shape data. Additional methods include preparing a robotic medical system for use with a shapeable instrument and controlling advancement of a shapeable medical device within an anatomic path. Also described herein are methods for altering a data model of an anatomical region.

2,"Computer system and method for defining and using a predictive model configured to predict asset failures 
        ","Disclosed herein are systems, devices, and methods related to assets and asset operating conditions. In particular, examples involve defining and using a predictive model that is configured to output an indication of whether at least one failure type from the group of possible failure types is likely to occur at an asset within the given period of time in the future.

3,"Package receiving locker 
        ","Package-receiving-lockers (PRLs) may have a collapsible-locker portion and door-attachment-structure. PRLs may exist in a substantially collapsed configuration for storing the given PRL or for otherwise minimizing a footprint of the given PRL; and these PRLs may exist in a substantially deployed (expanded) configuration for acting as a secure object storage location. Regardless of configuration (deployed or collapsed), PRLs may be removably attached to side-hinged-doors with the door-attachment-structure, in such a way so as not to impair operation of the given door. The PRLs may have various electronics for facilitating access (e.g., locking and unlocking the collapsible-locker), delivery confirmation, and mitigating theft. These electronics, along with specialized software, may allow an intended recipient (e.g., a buyer), a shipper/delivery person (or shipping/deliver robot), and/or a seller/vendor to access the PRL in a controlled and documented manner. At least some of these electronics may be in wireless communications with other electronic devices.
