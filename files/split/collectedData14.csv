0,Auto,"The system includes an air flow generator configured to deliver an air flow at a positive therapeutic pressure during the treatment, and an expiratory valve with an open pressure connected to the air flow generator. The open pressure is dependent on the therapeutic pressure from the air flow generator. The expiratory valve further exerts a back pressure upon each exhalation from the patient sufficient to create a pneumatic splint in the patient's respiratory tract. The exhalation from the patient has a first half followed by a second half, and the back pressure is varied such that during the start of the first half, the back pressure is between 0 and 50% of a peak back pressure, and increases to a peak back pressure in the second half.

1,"System, method and apparatus for power management 
        ","A system, method and apparatus provide management of power to meet demand of consumers that consume the power. An interface is configured to receive a pricing signal that indicates a price for the power. Wherein the interface is configured to control an appliance coupled to the interface to shift adjusting power consumption sooner in time than the appliance is predetermined to shift its power consumption.

2,"Swimwear design and construction 
        ","A wetsuit is provided which comprises (a) a first central region comprising a first material and having a first thickness; and (b) a second lateral region comprising a second material and having a second thickness. The buoyancy per unit area of the first region is greater than the buoyancy per unit area of the second region.

3,Systems and methods for predicting coronary plaque vulnerability from patient,"Systems and methods are disclosed for predicting coronary plaque vulnerability, using a computer system. One method includes acquiring anatomical image data of at least part of the patient's vascular system; performing, using a processor, one or more image characteristics analysis, geometrical analysis, computational fluid dynamics analysis, and structural mechanics analysis on the anatomical image data; predicting, using the processor, a coronary plaque vulnerability present in the patient's vascular system, wherein predicting the coronary plaque vulnerability includes calculating an adverse plaque characteristic based on results of the one or more of image characteristics analysis, geometrical analysis, computational fluid dynamics analysis, and structural mechanics analysis of the anatomical image data; and reporting, using the processor, the calculated adverse plaque characteristic.
