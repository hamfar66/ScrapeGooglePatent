0,"Methods and systems for assembly of crews for facilitating execution of social game activity 
        ","Methods and systems are provided for enabling a user of an online game to assemble a crew of additional crew members for accessing a content item after completing a goal with the crew. One example method includes sending, from the one or more servers to a client of a user, data for displaying a crew assembly dialog that includes a graphical user interface (GUI). The crew assembly dialog allowing the user to select crew members for assembling the crew for the online game. Sending, from the one or more servers in response to a selection made at the GUI, a help request directed to the at least one crew member for response from the at least one crew member. The method further includes assembling the crew based on the selection of the user for the at least one crew member and response of the at least one crew member to the help request. The assembling of the crew enables the user to make progress in the online game.

1,"Systems and methods for analysis of blood flow state 
        ","The present application relates to a method and system for analyzing blood flow conditions. The method includes: obtaining images at multiple time phases; constructing multiple vascular models corresponding to the multiple time phases; correlating the multiple vascular models; setting boundary conditions of the multiple vascular models respectively based on the result of correlation; and determining condition of blood vessel of the vascular models.

2,"Safe and stable control method for automobile tire burst 
        ","The invention relates to a safe and stable control method for automobile tire burst, which is used for vehicles with people and unmanned vehicles, is based on vehicle braking, driving, steering and suspension systems, and belongs to the field of automobile tire burst safety. The method determines tire burst detection, tire pressure state and steering mechanical state mode, and adopts a safe and stable control mode, a model and an algorithm, a control structure and a flow of automobile tire burst; based on the tire burst state point, vehicle braking, driving, steering wheel rotating force and suspension balance control are coordinated through entering and exiting of tire burst control and conversion of normal and tire burst control modes, and real or non-real tire burst process overlapping tire burst control is achieved; under the condition that the tire burst process state, the tire burst wheel and the vehicle motion state change rapidly, important technical barriers that the tire burst of the wheel and the vehicle is seriously unstable, the tire burst extreme state is difficult to control and the like are broken through, and the important problem which puzzles the tire burst safety of the automobile for a long time at present is solved.

3,"Power generating element 
        ","The power generation efficiency is to be enhanced by converting vibration energy including various direction components into electric energy without waste. A cantilever structure is adopted, in which a first plate-like bridge portion ( 120 ) and a second plate-like bridge portion ( 130 ) extend in a shape of a letter U from a fixing-portion ( 110 ) fixed to the device housing ( 200 ) and a weight body ( 150 ) is connected to the end. On the upper surface of the cantilever structure, a common lower layer electrode (E 00 ), a layered piezoelectric element ( 300 ) and discrete upper layer electrodes (Ex 1  to Ez 4 ) are formed. The upper layer electrodes (Ez 1  to Ez 4 ) disposed on a center line (Lx, Ly) of each plate-like bridge portion take out charge generated in the piezoelectric element ( 300 ) due to deflection caused by the Z-axis direction vibration of the weight body ( 150 ). The upper layer electrodes (Ex 1  to Ex 4 , Ey 1  to Ey 4 ) disposed on both sides of the center line (Lx, Ly) of the plate-like bridge portion take out charge generated in the piezoelectric element ( 300 ) due to deflection caused by the X-axis or Y-axis direction vibration of the weight body ( 150 ).
