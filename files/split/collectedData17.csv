0,"Systems and methods for creating target motion, capturing motion, analyzing motion, and improving motion 
        ","The present technology enables viewing, analyzing, and improve a variety of motions for a subject by facilitating comparison to a target video. Motions can include activities such as walking, athletic activities, and educational activities. The comparison can be accomplished by adjusting spatial aspects of a target and subject video to match. The comparison can also include identifying synchronization points, between the videos, that identify a temporal correspondence between of motions or objects in the videos and adjusting playback of one or more segments in the videos so corresponding synchronization points are displayed at the same time during playback. A version of one of the videos can be provided as an outline or as partially transparent, which can be overlaid with the other video to create a video combination for playback.

1,"Soft, wearable microfluidic systems capable of capture, storage, and sensing of biofluids 
        ","The invention provides systems for handling biofluids including the transport, capture, collection, storage, sensing, and/or evaluation of biofluids released by tissue. Systems of some aspects provide a versatile platform for characterization of a broad range of physical and/or chemical biofluid attributes in real time and over clinically relevant timeframes. Systems of some aspects provide for collection and/or analysis of biofluids from conformal, watertight tissue interfaces over time intervals allowing for quantitative temporal and/or volumetric characterization of biofluid release, such as release rates and release volumes.

2,"Waterproof stretchable optoelectronics 
        ","Described herein are flexible and stretchable LED arrays and methods utilizing flexible and stretchable LED arrays. Assembly of flexible LED arrays alongside flexible plasmonic crystals is useful for construction of fluid monitors, permitting sensitive detection of fluid refractive index and composition. Co-integration of flexible LED arrays with flexible photodetector arrays is useful for construction of flexible proximity sensors. Application of stretchable LED arrays onto flexible threads as light emitting sutures provides novel means for performing radiation therapy on wounds.
