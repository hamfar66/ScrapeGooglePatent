0,"System and method of revealing the outcomes of real world wagers based on a geolocation of a user 
        ","The invention relates to systems and methods of placing real-world wagers, obtaining outcomes of the real-world wagers, facilitating user interactions with various interactive media, and revealing the outcomes of the real-world wagers through location-based reveals to give an appearance that the outcomes of the real-world wagers resulted from the user location even though the outcomes resulted from the real-world wagers. The system may associate certain locations with a reveal such that when a user enters, is determined to be at, and/or leaves a reveal location, a reveal opportunity may be presented to the user. For example, the system may invite the user to make a purchase at a nearby partner retailer for a chance to win a payout or be guaranteed to win a payout and/or may simply obtain a particular payout (e.g., via cash, item, etc.) when a user enters a particular location.

2,"Computer interface for manipulated objects with an absolute pose detection component 
        ","A manipulated object using high optical contrast features and an on-board photodetector that detects light produced, reflected or scattered by the features and outputs data indicative thereof. The manipulated object uses one or more controllers to determine its position and/or orientation, including full pose, in the real three-dimensional environment based on data from the photodetector. Data from one or more auxiliary motion sensing devices, e.g., a relative motion sensor such as an inertial device or other auxiliary motion device relying on acoustics, optics or electromagnetic waves within or outside the visible spectrum, can be used to supplement the position and/or orientation data from the photodetector. The manipulated object can be embodied by any suitable device manipulated by a user, including a tablet computer or a phone.

3,"Detection of asynchrony 
      ","A controller or processor(s) implements detection of respiratory related conditions, such as asynchrony, associated with use of a respiratory treatment apparatus or ventilator. Based on data derived from sensor signals associated with the respiratory treatment, the detector may evaluate a feature set of detection values to determine whether or not an asynchrony occurs in a breath of the patient's respiratory cycle such as by comparing the values against a set of thresholds. Different events may also be identified based on the particular feature set and threshold(s) involved in the detection processing. Automated determination of feature sets may also be implemented to design different asynchrony event classifiers. The methodologies may be implemented by computers or by respiratory treatment apparatus. The detection of such asynchrony events can then also serve as part of control logic for automated adjustments to the control parameters of the respiratory treatment generated by the respiratory treatment apparatus.
