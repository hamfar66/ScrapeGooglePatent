0,Multi,"The invention provides a multi-scale and multi-physical field coupling simulation method for metal additive manufacturing, which comprises the following steps of: s1, establishing a metal additive manufacturing process data model; s2, on a microscopic scale, performing first principle calculation through first principle calculation software to obtain microscopic physical properties of the additive metal material; s3, establishing an NxNxN super-cell model of the additive metal material, and carrying out molecular dynamics simulation calculation through molecular dynamics simulation software; s4, on the mesoscopic scale, researching the plasma generated in the process of melting the metal powder by heating the electron beam or the laser; s5, performing simulation calculation by using a flow-heat-solid-magnetic multi-physical field coupling simulation platform; and S6, establishing a process parameter feedback control model aiming at different defect types and distribution conditions, and optimizing metal additive manufacturing process parameters. According to the invention, a macro-micro integrated metal additive manufacturing product quality prediction system is formed by means of multi-scale multi-physical field coupling simulation.

1,"Method for implementing a computer game 
        ","A method, implemented as computer code being executed by one or more processors, in which computer game graphics for a casual, social game are shown on a display of a computing device, where the casual, social game is downloaded as an app to a smartphone and/or tablet computer and can be accessed or played using a social network application or environment; and in which one or more of the processors are programmed such that: a notification is automatically generated if a player is stuck at a level for more than a defined time or after more than a defined number of attempts to pass that level, the notification alerting friends of the player so that they can assist him or her.

2,"Epidermal Devices for Analysis of Temperature and Thermal Transport Characteristics 
      ","Provided are tissue-mounted devices and methods for monitoring a thermal transport property (e.g., thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, heat capacity) of tissue, such as skin. The devices conformally mount to the tissue and have one or more thermal actuators and a plurality of sensors. The actuator applies heat to the tissue and the sensors to detect a spatio temporal distribution of a physiological tissue parameter or physical property resulting from the heating. This spatio temporal information may be correlated with a rate, velocity and/or direction of blood flow, the presence of a vascular occlusion, circulation changes due to inflammation, hydration level and other physiological parameters.

3,"Play Sequence Visualization and Analysis 
        ","A method for visualizing plays in a sporting event may include receiving a video stream of the sporting event and a measurement stream, asynchronous to the video stream, associated with objects in the sporting event. The method may further include displaying a synchronized presentation of the video stream and the measurement stream. The synchronization may be performed near the time of the displaying. Another method for visualizing plays in a sporting event may include receiving measurement information related to actions from one or more sporting events. The method may also include identifying plays from the actions using the measurement information and displaying a representation of the identified plays. A system for visualizing plays in a sporting event may include an integrated server and a synchronization mechanism. Another method for visualizing plays in a sporting event may include displaying a video of a play selected from a representation.
