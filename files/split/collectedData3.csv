0,"System and method for adapting a control function based on a user profile 
        ","The vehicle control system/method for adapting a control function based on a user profile may comprise: a gesture recognition module; a user profile module; a function control module; a processor; a non-transitory storage element coupled to the processor; encoded instructions stored in the non-transitory storage element, wherein the encoded instructions when implemented by the processor, configure the system to: identify a user; retrieve a user profile for the identified user; receive at a gesture recognition module, an input indicating a gesture from the user; identify a control function request corresponding to the gesture input; send a verification of the control function request; and receive at a function control module characteristics parsed from the user profile that effect the control function request by the user profile module to adapt a control function command for an adapted control function output by the function control module.

1,"Presenting refueling information using a mobile communication device 
      ","A mobile communication device aids a driver of an automobile to locate a refueling vender. The mobile communication device receives signals containing information regarding refueling venders within a vicinity of the location of the device. In response to a request to locate a refueling vender within a limited geographic of the device and based on the received information regarding refueling venders within a vicinity of the device, the device displays on a touchscreen information—including price and location—regarding a set of selected refueling venders that satisfy the selection criteria. The driver can request additional information regarding a chosen one of the refueling venders, and the device determines and displays driving directions from the location of device to the location of the chosen one of the refueling venders the driving directions to thereby assist the driver to drive to the chosen one of the refueling venders to refuel.

2,Nano,"Examples of nano-level evaluation of kerogen-rich reservoir rock are described. A micro-scale beam is formed from kerogen-rich reservoir rock. The beam has reservoir rock and kerogen, which has polymeric properties. A maximum dimension of the micro-scale beam is at most 1000 micrometers. A mechanical experiment that includes a tension test or a compression test is performed on the micro-scale beam. The mechanical experiment is imaged using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A material parameter of the kerogen in the micro-scale beam is determined based on results of the mechanical experiment and images obtained responsive to the imaging. The material parameter includes a behavior of the kerogen in response to the mechanical experiment. The behavior of the kerogen can be used to determine, among other things, the energy required to break kerogen in a kerogen-rich shale to improve hydraulic fracturing efficiency.

3,Multi,"Disclosed herein is a multi-functional hand-held device capable of configuring user inputs based on how the device is to be used. Preferably, the multi-functional hand-held device has at most only a few physical buttons, keys, or switches so that its display size can be substantially increased. The multi-functional hand-held device also incorporates a variety of input mechanisms, including touch sensitive screens, touch sensitive housings, display actuators, audio input, etc. The device also incorporates a user-configurable GUI for each of the multiple functions of the devices.

4,"Staple cartridge including a compressible member 
        ","A staple cartridge comprising a cartridge body, a surgical staple, and a compressible member is disclosed. The surgical staple is movable from an unfired position to a fired position. The surgical staple is deformable from a first shape in the unfired position to a second shape in the fired position during a firing stroke. The surgical staple is ejected from the cartridge body during the firing stroke. The surgical staple comprises a crown, a first deformable member extending from the crown, and a second deformable member extending from the crown. The compressible member is positioned intermediate the first deformable member, the second deformable member, and the crown after the surgical staple has been deformed into the second shape. The compressible member is at least partially positioned between the first deformable member and the second deformable member of the surgical staple when the surgical staple is in the unfired position.
