1,"Nonlinear system identification techniques and devices for discovering dynamic and static tissue properties 
        ","A device for measuring a mechanical property of a tissue includes a probe configured to perturb the tissue with movement relative to a surface of the tissue, an actuator coupled to the probe to move the probe, a detector configured to measure a response of the tissue to the perturbation, and a controller coupled to the actuator and the detector. The controller drives the actuator using a stochastic sequence and determines the mechanical property of the tissue using the measured response received from the detector. The probe can be coupled to the tissue surface. The device can include a reference surface configured to contact the tissue surface. The probe may include a set of interchangeable heads, the set including a head for lateral movement of the probe and a head for perpendicular movement of the probe. The perturbation can include extension of the tissue with the probe or sliding the probe across the tissue surface and may also include indentation of the tissue with the probe. In some embodiments, the actuator includes a Lorentz force linear actuator. The mechanical property may be determined using non-linear stochastic system identification. The mechanical property may be indicative of, for example, tissue compliance and tissue elasticity. The device can further include a handle for manual application of the probe to the surface of the tissue and may include an accelerometer detecting an orientation of the probe. The device can be used to test skin tissue of an animal, plant tissue, such as fruit and vegetables, or any other biological tissue.

2,"Method and system for modeling and simulating a fractured reservoir 
        ","The present disclosure describes methods and systems to enhance subsurface models of fractured reservoirs. In particular, the methods and systems described herein incorporate the effects of “dynamic” compressible fractures and, thus, can improve predictions of fractured reservoir performance over time. The methods and systems may utilize predictive algorithms for mechanical and hydraulic stiffness properties of the fracture network that are based at least in part on a database of measurements derived from single fractures.
