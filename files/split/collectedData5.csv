0,"Method for improved design of hydraulic fracture height in a subterranean laminated rock formation 
        ","A method for hydraulic fracturing a subterranean formation traversed by a wellbore, 
comprising: characterizing the subterranean formation using measured properties of the 
subterranean formation, wherein the measured properties of the subterranean formation include 
mechanical properties of geological interfaces, and wherein characterizing the subterranean 
formation comprises characterizing a weak mechanical interface between adjacent lithological 
layers; identifying a formation fracture height, wherein the identifying comprises calculating a 
fracture height growth using the subterranean formation characterization to analyze interaction of 
a formation fracture tip with the weak mechanical interface; and fracturing the subterranean 
formation, wherein a fluid viscosity or a fluid flow rate or both are selected using the calculated 
fracture height growth.

2,"Robotic catheter system 
        ","A robotic catheter system includes a controller with a master input device. An instrument driver is in communication with the controller and has a guide instrument interface including a plurality of guide instrument drive elements responsive to control signals generated, at least in part, by the master input device. An elongate guide instrument has a base, distal end, and a working lumen, wherein the guide instrument base is operatively coupled to the guide instrument interface. The guide instrument includes a plurality of guide instrument control elements operatively coupled to respective guide drive elements and secured to the distal end of the guide instrument. The guide instrument control elements are axially moveable relative to the guide instrument such that movement of the guide instrument distal end may be controlled by the master input device.

3,"Vision system for a vehicle 
        ","A vehicular vision system includes a driver-side exterior mirror assembly, a passenger-side mirror assembly and an interior mirror assembly. The fields of view of the mirror reflective elements of the exterior mirror assemblies are adjustable by the driver via a respective actuator. The exterior mirror assemblies include respective cameras that each have a respective rearward field of view that supplements the field of view of the mirror reflective element when viewed by the driver of the vehicle. A video display is disposed behind the mirror reflector of an interior mirror reflective element such that displayed video images are viewable through the mirror reflector of the interior mirror reflective element. The video display includes a driver-side display portion and a passenger-side display portion that each display images derived from image data captured by the respective camera while not displaying images derived from image data captured by the other camera.
