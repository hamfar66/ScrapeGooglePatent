0,"Surgical instrument with firing lockout 
        ","A surgical instrument comprising an end effector, a firing member, an electric motor, a first lockout, and a control system comprising a second lockout is disclosed. The end effector is configured to support a removable staple cartridge. The firing member is movable toward a distal end of the end effector during a firing motion. The electric motor is configured to drive the firing member during the firing motion. The first lockout is mechanically engageable with the firing member. The control system is configured to prevent delivery of electrical power to the electric motor based on respective states of the first and second lockouts.

1,"Instrument systems and methods utilizing optical fiber sensor 
        ","An instrument system that includes an elongate instrument body and an optical fiber sensor is provided. The optical fiber sensor includes an elongate optical fiber that is coupled to the elongate instrument body, wherein a portion of the optical fiber is coupled to the elongate instrument body in a manner to provide slack in the fiber to allow for axial extension of the elongate instrument body relative to the optical fiber.

3,"Drilling control system and drilling control method 
        ","A drilling control system includes a drilling apparatus and a control unit for controlling the drilling apparatus. The drilling device includes a surgical tool, a drilling motor capable of driving the surgical tool, a mechanical sensor for detecting mechanical information, a mechanical arm assembly for receiving an output control signal and detecting spindle information, and a mechanical arm assembly Install the console of the robot arm assembly. The control unit is coupled to a spatial sensing system. The control unit stores biomechanical information and generates a drilling information based on the mechanical information generated from the mechanical sensor, the spatial information generated by the spatial sensing system, and the spindle information. The control unit further calculates a deviation index according to the biomechanical information and the drilling information, and sends an output control signal to the drilling device according to the deviation indicator. The invention also provides a drilling control method.
