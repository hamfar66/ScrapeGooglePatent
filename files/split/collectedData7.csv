0,"Method for numerically simulating orthodontic effect of orthodontic appliance 
        ","The present application discloses a method for numerically simulating orthodontic effect of an orthodontic appliance. The method comprising: providing a numerical dental model representing a patient's dental tissues, wherein the numerical dental model comprises mechanical parameters and geometrical parameters of the patient's dental tissues; providing a numerical orthodontic appliance model representing an orthodontic appliance, the orthodontic appliance corresponding to an expected orthodontic state, and the numerical orthodontic appliance model comprising mechanical parameters and geometrical parameters of the orthodontic appliance; combining the numerical orthodontic appliance model with the numerical dental model to simulate wearing of the orthodontic appliance on the patient's dental tissues; calculating orthodontic change after the wearing of the orthodontic appliance on the patient's dental tissues, based on the mechanical parameters and geometrical parameters included in the numerical orthodontic appliance model and the numerical dental model respectively; and assessing the orthodontic effect of the numerical orthodontic appliance model based on the orthodontic change.

2,"Method and apparatus for biometric data capture 
      ","A method and apparatus for biometric data capture are provided. The apparatus includes in interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user that includes an optical assembly through which a user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly comprises a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment and an integrated processor for handling content to the user. An integrated optical sensor captures biometric data when the eyepiece is positioned so that a nearby individual is proximate to the eyepiece. Biometric data is captured using the eyepiece and is transmitted to a remote processing facility for interpretation. The remote processing facility interprets the captured biometric data and generates display content based on the interpretation. This display content is delivered to the eyepiece and displayed to the user.

3,"Efficiencies and flexibilities in inductive charging 
        ","Systems and methods are provided for inductive powering and/or charging of electric or electronic devices or batteries. For example, a system may comprise a base unit, such as a charger or power supply, which includes one or more primary coils generally having a planar or curved surface. Each primary coil can be activated to generate a magnetic field in a direction substantially perpendicular to the planar or curved surface to provide power to one or more inductive power receiver coils of a receiver to power or charge one or more portable devices or batteries. The base unit is capable of detecting a wireless communication signal or a modulation communication signal in the one or more primary coils created by modulation of the receiver's impedance and is capable of using the wireless communication signal or the modulation communication signal to control output voltage, current or power from the receiver.
