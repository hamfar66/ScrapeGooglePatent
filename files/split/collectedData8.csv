0,"Method for a dynamic perpetual encryption cryptosystem 
        ","A dynamic computer communication security encryption method or system using an initial seed key and multiple random number generators of a specific design, whereby a sequence of independent random entropy values is produced by one set of random number generators and encrypted along with the message stream using the initial seed key, or the output of a second set of random number generators initialized with the initial seed key, and following the subsequent transmission of the variable encrypted entropy/message block, the entropy values are used to symmetrically or identically augment or increase the current uncertainty or entropy of the cryptosystem at both the sender and the receiver, prior to the next encryption block operation. The encryption process effectively entailing the use of multiple encryption ciphers, and the entropy augmentation process entailing the encryption or application of various logical mathematical operations on the already dynamic but deterministic internal state values of the second set of random number generators, effectively altering their deterministic outputs in a random probabilistic manner. 
     Random length message value sequences from one or more data sources is combined with one or more random length entropy value sequences from an independent source, following which the entropy “updates” may also be used to alter, or change any cryptosystem variable, value or component in a randomly determined manner. In addition, while ensuring synchronization, the random entropy sequences also serve to “pollute” the cipher-stream and thereby hinder most current forms of cryptanalysis, while simultaneously injecting additional entropy into the cryptographic system and allowing for its propagation to affect any connected system nodes, and thereby introducing unpredictable entropy into the system pseudorandom number generator outputs, and thereby ensuring the perpetual generation of unpredictable random numbers. 
     Super-encryption mechanics are independent of the user data, simple, fast and efficient, and can incorporate compression, error correction and asymmetric encryption authentication routines. But most importantly, super-encryption ensures resistance to brute force attacks (not possible to verify if a message was even sent), an ability to exceed “perfect secrecy” requirements, and an improvement on previous super-encipherment design, since overhead can be dramatically reduced from 100% overhead. 
     Communication links previously established by system nodes with central authorities may be used for secure node authentication and registration, while allowing the central authority to broker and synchronize communication channels and providing mutual authentication and other security functions between the system nodes.
