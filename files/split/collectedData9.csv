5 ABSTRACT 
The present disclosure relates to a method incorporating computer-implemented 
steps, a computing device, and a computer readable storage medium, for providing 
alignment information data for the alignment of an orthopaedic implant for a joint of a 
patient. The method comprises the computer-implemented steps of being responsive 
0 to patient specific information data for deriving patient data, where the patient 
specific information data is indicative of one or more dynamic characteristics, and 
being responsive to the patient data for providing the alignment information data for 
the alignment of the orthopaedic implant.

3,Torque,"A robotic surgical system configured for the articulation of a catheter comprises an input device, a control computer, and an instrument driver having at least one motor for displacing the pull-wire of a steerable catheter wherein the control computer is configured to determine the desired motor torque or tension of the pull-wire of a catheter based on user manipulation of the input device. The control computer is configured to output the desired motor torque or tension of the pull-wire to the instrument driver, whereby at least one motor of the instrument driver implements the desired motor torque to cause the desired pull-wire tension to articulate the distal tip of the catheter.
